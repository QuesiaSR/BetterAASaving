# BetterAASaving

This mod makes it so whenever criteria is met for an advancement, the game will save the world.

This ties in really well with [AATool](https://github.com/DarwinBaker/AATool), as with this mod you don't have to pause for it to update.

This is also really useful for Coop runs, because in Coop the player data only gets saved every 5 minutes.

I've made it so that it waits `1 second` after getting the first call of a criterion being met, and then saves. This is to avoid lag.
